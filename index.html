        <h2>Why should you join as a student?</h2>
        <p>Students are the main focus of the International Douglas-Young Tournament (DYT). The competition is designed to not only be academically rewarding but also to be socially enriching. Students can expect to build lasting relationships with other students around the world and enjoy their stay at the tournament’s venue. Students can join the process in one of two ways: as a participant or as their school’s student ambassador.
<br><br>
            The student ambassador role is a prestigious leadership position where students complete many tasks such as marketing the competition, communicating with organisers and their school administration, adapting the tournament details to their unique school, and many more. The student ambassador role is also a CAS project for the designated student in charge and student ambassadors are automatically invited to the second round, prize-giving ceremony, and post-tournament celebration which will be held in Denmark. Student ambassadors also have the potential to earn the “Best Student Ambassador” award. Student ambassador positions are available to any IB or Pre-IB student who proves themselves to be charismatic, ambitious, and capable of problem-solving.
            <br><br>
            As a participant, students will compete against each other in two separate rounds which will test their knowledge, research, organising, and communication abilities in their chosen subject. Students are allowed to choose one subject to specialise in which additionally does not have to be one they study – although recommended. Participant roles are open to any Pre-IB or IB student and are an amazing source of creativity CAS. The tournament rounds are designed to be challenging, competitive, and fast to complete to not take time away from students’ studies. We will award a total of 43 prizes to 43 different participants. There will be a first, second, third, fourth, and fifth prize for each subject as well as three separate prizes for three different categories: best speaker, most creative, and best handwriting. Prizes will range from gift cards to international trips and all participants are guaranteed a certificate of completion. Regardless of the prizes, being a participant in the competition is an incredible experience that you do not want to miss!
